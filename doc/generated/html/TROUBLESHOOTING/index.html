<h2 id="kconf">1. Kernel configuration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>When configuring the Linux kernel, some options should be avoided.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This allows the CPU frequency to be modulated with
workload, but many CPUs change the TSC counting frequency also, which
makes it useless for accurate timing when the CPU clock can
change. Also some CPUs can take several milliseconds to ramp up to
full speed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
CONFIG_CPU_IDLE
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Allows the CPU to enter deep sleep states,
increasing the time it takes to get out of these sleep states, hence
the latency of an idle system. Also, on some CPU, entering these deep
sleep states causes the timers used by Xenomai to stop functioning.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
CONFIG_CC_STACKPROTECTOR
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This option must be disabled on all platforms
except x86_64: it requires changes to the context switches currently
only implemented for x86_64.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
CONFIG_KGDB
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
This option can not be enabled with current versions of
the I-pipe patch.
</p>
</dd>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This means that the kernel crashes before the console is enabled. You
should enable the <tt>CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK</tt> option. For some architectures
(blackfin, x86, arm), enabling this option also requires passing the
<tt>earlyprintk</tt> parameter on the kernel command line. See

<div class="paragraph"><p>You selected a CPU which as a TSC ("Pentium classic", and above), but
the CPU on which you run the kernel has no TSC. This issue was
resolved in the I-pipe core for Linux 3.4, but for prior versions, you

<div class="paragraph"><p>This may also happen when using I-pipe core patch for Linux 3.2,
compiled for a CPU with a TSC, but running on a CPU without a TSC, as
in the <a href="#notsc">"Xenomai: compiled for TSC</a> case.</p></div>

<h3 id="SMI">2.8. Xenomai: SMI-enabled chipset found, but SMI workaround disabled</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First you should run the latency test under some load and see if
you experience any pathological latency ("pathological" meaning more
than, say, 100 micro-seconds). If you do not observe any such latency,
then this warning is harmless, and if you find it annoying, you may
disable "SMI detection" in Xenomai&#8217;s configuration menu. You can skip
the rest of this section.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you observe any high latency then you have a problem with SMI, and
this warning was intended for you. But the Xenomai configuration menu
allow you to enable two workarounds which may help you. These
workarounds may be found in the Machine/SMI workaround sub-menu of
Xenomai configuration menu.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first workaround which you should try is to disable all SMI
sources. In order to do this, in the Xenomai configuration menu, select
the options "Enable SMI workaround" and "Globally disable SMI". This
option is the safest workaround, because when enabled, no SMI can
interfere with hardware interrupt management behind your back and
cause high latencies.  Once this workaround enabled, you should run
the latency test again, verify that your high latency disappeared but
most importantly, verify that every peripheral you intend to use with
Xenomai is working properly. If everything is working properly, then you
are done with SMI.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If some peripheral is not working properly, then it probably needs
SMI, in which case you can not simply disable SMI globally, you will
need to disable all SMI sources on your system except the SMI needed
by your peripheral. This is a much less safe choice, since Xenomai has
to know all SMI sources to disable them, one by one. In order to
choose this second workaround, unselect the option "Globally disable
SMI", and select the option corresponding to your peripheral. For
example, if you need legacy USB emulation to get your USB mouse
working, select the option "Enable legacy USB emulation". You should
then run the latency test again and verify that you do not observe any
high latency and that all your peripherals are functioning
correctly. If you can not find your peripheral in the list proposed in
the Xenomai configuration menu, drop a mail to the
<a href="mailto:xenomai@xenomai.org">Xenomai mailing list</a>, we will try and
possibly add the proper option if needed. If when running the latency
test again, your peripheral is working properly and you still observe
high latencies, then you are out of luck, the peripheral you want is
likely to be the cause of such latencies.</p></div>

<h3 id="ENODEV">2.9. Xenomai: system init failed, code -19</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most probable reason is that Xenomai could not find a timer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Check that you have not enabled one of the options in the
<a href="#kconf">"Kernel configuration"</a> section.</p></div>
<h4 id="_on_x86">2.9.1. On x86</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You will most likely also see the following message:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>Xenomai: Local APIC absent or disabled!
Disable APIC support or pass "lapic" as bootparam.</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xenomai sends this message if the kernel configuration Xenomai was
compiled against enables the local APIC support
(<tt>CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC</tt>), but the processor status gathered at boot
time by the kernel says that no local APIC support is available.
There are two options for fixing this issue:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
either your CPU really has <em>no</em> local APIC hw, then you need to
rebuild a kernel with LAPIC support disabled, before rebuilding
Xenomai against the latter;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
or it does have a local APIC but the kernel boot parameters did not
specify to activate it using the "lapic" option. The latter is
required since 2.6.9-rc4 for boxen which APIC hardware is disabled by
default by the BIOS. You may want to look at the file
<em>Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt</em> from the Linux source tree, for
more information about this parameter.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h4 id="_on_amd_x86_64">2.9.2. On AMD x86_64</h4>

</div>
<h4 id="_on_other_supported_platforms">2.9.3. On other supported platforms</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As on x86, on other platforms where Xenomai shares the timer with
Linux, the timer is only used if it was not shut down by Linux. So you
should check the log for messages about disabled timers. You can also
check <em>/proc/timer_list</em> to see which timers are enabled. For
instance, Xenomai on SMP systems requires per-cpu local timers, so the
local timers should be enabled. In case of doubt, post a message to
<a href="mailto:xenomai@xenomai.org">the xenomai mailing list</a>, sending:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>

<h4 id="_on_a_new_i_pipe_port">2.9.4. On a new I-pipe port</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You will most likely also see the following message:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>I-pipe: could not find timer for cpu #x</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Starting with the I-pipe patch for Linux 3.2, the timers provided by
the I-pipe patch to Xenomai are registered at run-time. So, you may
lack a <tt>struct ipipe_timer</tt> definition, and its registration with
<tt>ipipe_timer_register()</tt> or with the <tt>ipipe_timer</tt> member of the
<tt>struct clock_event_device</tt> structure.</p></div>

<h3 id="_xenomai_system_init_failed_code_22">2.10. Xenomai: system init failed, code -22</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the ppc64 platform, check whether <tt>CONFIG_PPC_64K_PAGES</tt> is defined
in your kernel configuration. If so, then you likely need to raise all
Xenomai parameters defining the size of internal heaps, such as
<tt>CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SYS_HEAPSZ</tt>, <tt>CONFIG_XENO_OPT_GLOBAL_SEM_HEAPSZ</tt>,
<tt>CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SEM_HEAPSZ</tt> and <tt>CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SYS_STACKPOOLSZ</tt>, so
that (size / 64k) &gt; 2. The default values for these
parameters are currently based on the assumption that PAGE_SIZE = 4k.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="latency">3. Problems when running the latency test</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first test to run to see if Xenomai is running correctly on your
platform is the latency test. The following sections describe the
usual reasons for this test not to run correctly.</p></div>
<h3 id="_xenomai_binding_failed_operation_not_permitted">3.1. Xenomai: binding failed: Operation not permitted</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This error message means that you are trying to run the latency test
as a non-root user. Using Xenomai services requires root privileges
(more precisely <tt>CAP_SYS_NICE</tt>). However, you can allow a specific group
to access Xenomai services, by following the instructions on
<a href="http://xenomai.org/index.php/Non-root_RT">this page</a>.</p></div>
<h3 id="_xenomai_enable_x86_sep_needs_nptl_and_linux_2_6_x_or_higher">3.2. Xenomai: --enable-x86-sep needs NPTL and Linux 2.6.x or higher</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the x86 architecture, the configure script option
<tt>--enable-x86-sep</tt> allows Xenomai to use the SYSENTER/SYSEXIT
mechanism for issuing system calls.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, this mechanism requires support from the libc. Currently, we
know the glibc with NPTL has this support, other libraries will cause
Xenomai applications to fail with this error message.</p></div>
<h3 id="_latency_failed_to_open_benchmark_device">3.3. latency: failed to open benchmark device</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You have launched <tt>latency -t 1</tt> or <tt>latency -t 2</tt> which both require
the kernel to have been compiled with the
<tt>CONFIG_XENO_DRIVERS_TIMERBENCH</tt> option enabled.</p></div>
<h3 id="_hardware_tsc_is_not_a_fast_wrapping_one">3.4. Hardware tsc is not a fast wrapping one</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>See the <a href="#arm-tsc">"ARM tsc emulation issues"</a> section.</p></div>
<h3 id="_xenomai_incompatible_abi_revision_level">3.5. Xenomai: incompatible ABI revision level</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Each Xenomai branch (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6,&#8230;) defines a
kernel/user ABI, so that it is possible to mix kernels and user-space
supports of different versions in the same branch. So, for instance,
after having build a system with a kernel and user-space support using
Xenomai 2.6.0, it is possible to update the user-space support to
Xenomai 2.6.1 without changing the kernel.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, it is not possible to mix kernel and user-space supports of
different branches.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A common reason for this error is when you run a kernel compiled with
Xenomai 2.6.1 support on a system where you have a user-space
installed by your Debian based Linux distribution (notably Ubuntu)
from the 2.5 branch, this can not work, the two branches use different
ABIs. See <a href="../README.INSTALL/index.html">README.INSTALL</a> for details on how
to compile a user-space support, or to build a new <tt>xenomai-runtime</tt>
Debian package.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you compiled and installed the correct Xenomai user-space support,
there are probably files on your system remaining from a previous
installation.</p></div>
<h3 id="_xenomai_incompatible_feature_set">3.6. Xenomai: incompatible feature set</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since kernel-space support and user-space support are compiled
separately, each Xenomai application checks, at startup, whether the
kernel and user-space supports have been configured with compatible
options. If you see this message, it means they have not. See
<a href="../README.INSTALL/index.html#_feature_conflict_resolution">README.INSTALL</a>
for further details. The following sections detail the most frequent
reasons for this message.</p></div>
<h4 id="_missing_kuser_tsc">3.6.1. missing="kuser_tsc"</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>See the <a href="#arm-tsc">"ARM tsc emulation issues"</a> section.</p></div>
<h4 id="_missing_sep">3.6.2. missing="sep"</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the x86 architecture, the configure script option
<tt>--enable-x86-sep</tt> allows Xenomai to use the SYSENTER/SYSEXIT
mechanism for issuing system calls.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, this mechanism requires a recent kernel (2.6 or higher).</p></div>
<h4 id="_missing_smp_nosmp">3.6.3. missing="smp/nosmp"</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On some SMP-capable architectures, for kernel-space and user-space
supports to be compatible, both should be compiled with the same
setting for SMP.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>SMP support in kernel-space is enabled with the <tt>CONFIG_SMP</tt> option.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For these architectures, SMP support in user-space is enabled by
passing <tt>--enable-smp</tt> to the configure script, and disabled by passing
<tt>--disable-smp</tt> (SMP is enabled by default on some platforms).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Other SMP-capable architectures may run userland code built with
<tt>--enable-smp</tt> or <tt>--disable-smp</tt> over the same kernel indifferently, at
no noticeable performance cost. These architectures never receive such
SMP-related error.</p></div>
<h4 id="_missing_tsc">3.6.4. missing="tsc"</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This error is specific to the x86 architecture. You enabled tsc in
user-space by passing the <tt>--enable-x86-tsc</tt> option, but you selected
a processor when configuring the kernel which has no tsc.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, if your processor has a tsc (all Intel processors starting with
some Pentium and Pentium Pro have a tsc), you probably mis-configured
your kernel and should select the exact processor you are using in the
kernel configuration and recompile it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your processor does not have a tsc, you should not pass the
<tt>--enable-x86-tsc</tt> option to the configure script.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Possible reasons for this error are:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
you booted a kernel without Xenomai or I-pipe support, a kernel with
I-pipe and Xenomai support should have a <em>/proc/ipipe/version</em> and

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the kernel you booted does not have the <tt>CONFIG_XENO_SKIN_NATIVE</tt> and

<li>
<p>
you are trying to run Xenomai user-space support compiled for x86_32
on an x86_64 kernel.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h3 id="_latency_not_found">3.9. latency: not found</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the ARM platform this message happens when there is a mismatch
between kernel and user for the EABI setting: for instance you
compiled the user-space support with a toolchain generating OABI code,
and are trying to run the result on a kernel with <tt>CONFIG_AEABI</tt> but
without <tt>CONFIG_OABI_COMPAT</tt>. Or vice versa, when running user-space
compiled with an EABI toolchain on a kernel without <tt>CONFIG_AEABI</tt>.</p></div>
<h3 id="short-period">3.10. Xenomai: watchdog triggered (period too short?)</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xenomai watchdog has stopped the latency test because it was using all

<li>
<p>
if you do not have this option at BIOS configuration level, it does
not necessarily mean that there is no support for it, thus no
potential for high latencies; this support might just be forcibly
enabled at boot time. To solve this, in case your machine has some USB
controller hardware, make sure to enable the corresponding host
controller driver support in your kernel configuration. For instance,
UHCI-compliant hardware needs <tt>CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD</tt>. As part of its
init chores, the driver should reset the host controller properly,
kicking out the BIOS off the concerned hardware, and deactivate the
USB legacy mode if set in the same move.

counter. On x86, the counter used for this purpose is the time-stamp
counter, aka "tsc".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>ARM processors generally do not have a 64 bits high resolution counter
available in user-space, so this counter is emulated by reading
whatever high resolution counter is available on the processor, and
used as clock source in kernel-space, and extend it to 64 bits by
using data shared with the kernel. If Xenomai libraries are compiled
without emulated tsc support, system calls are used, which have a much
higher overhead than the emulated tsc code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In recent versions of the I-pipe patch, SOCs generally select the
<tt>CONFIG_IPIPE_ARM_KUSER_TSC</tt> option, which means that the code for
reading this counter is provided by the kernel at a predetermined
address (in the vector page, a page which is mapped at the same
address in every process) and is the code used if you do not pass the
<tt>--enable-arm-tsc</tt> or <tt>--disable-arm-tsc</tt> option to configure, or pass
<tt>--enable-arm-tsc=kuser</tt>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This default should be fine with recent patches and most ARM
SOCs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, if you see the following message:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>So you should resort to what Xenomai did before branch 2.6: select the

<h3 id="_high_latencies_when_transitioning_from_primary_to_secondary_mode">6.3. High latencies when transitioning from primary to secondary mode</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Such transition requires to wake up the Linux task underlying your
real-time thread when running in secondary mode, since the latter
needs to leave the Xenomai domain for executing under the control of the
regular Linux scheduler. Therefore, it all depends on the Linux kernel
granularity, i.e. its ability to reach the next rescheduling point as
soon as such wakeup has been requested. Additionally, the task wakeup
request is performed from a virtual interrupt handler which has to be
run from the Linux domain upon request from the Xenomai domain, so the
time required to handle and dispatch this interrupt outside of any
critical kernel section also needs to be accounted for. Even if the
kernel granularity improves at each new release, there are still a few
catches:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Although the use of DMA might induce additional interrupt latency
due to bus bandwidth saturation, disabling it for disk I/O is a bad
idea when using mixed real-time modes. This is due to the fact that
using PIO often leads to lengthy non-preemptible sections of kernel
code being run from e.g. IDE drivers, from which pending real-time
mode transitions could be delayed. In the same vein, make sure that
your IDE driver runs in unmasked IRQ mode. In any case, a quick check
using the "hdparm" tool will help:
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># hdparm -v /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
 ...
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 ...</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Even if your application does not directly request disk I/O, remember
that the kernel routinely performs housekeeping duties which do, like
filesystem journal updates or VM commits to the backing store, so
latencies due to improper disk settings may well trigger apparently
randomly. Of course, if your application only operates in primary mode
during all of its time critical duties, i.e. never request Linux
syscalls, it will not be adversely affected by DMA deactivation or IDE
masking, since it will remain in the Xenomai domain, and activities from
such domain can preempt any activity from the Linux domain, including
disk drivers.

situations even appear during runtime on systems with limited memory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Xenomai tasks are underlaid by native POSIX threads, for which a

<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately, this behaviour cannot be controlled by the
