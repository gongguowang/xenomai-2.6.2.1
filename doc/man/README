To add the new foo.1 manual page, you have to:
- add a foo.adoc file in the doc/man directory
- add foo to the HTML_DOCS variable (to generate the html version of the
manual page) in doc/man/Makefile.am
- add foo.adoc to the EXTRA_DIST variable in doc/man/Makefile.am
- add foo.1 to the man1_MANS variable
- run scripts/bootstrap; configure


Then you should be able to run make in the build directory.
